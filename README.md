# Titanic_Survival_Prediction
I have Created a Machine Learning Model based on the Logistic Regression algorithm.
</br>
This Model is capable of predicting whether the person will survive or not survive based on the given data of that particular person.
</br>
This Model is highly accurate in predicting the result.
</br>
It has the Accuracy score of 0.800561797752809 i.e. approximately 80.05% on the Training data and the Accuracy score of 0.7932960893854749 i.e. approximately 79.33% on the Testing data.
</br>
Making this model Highly accurate in predicting the result of survived people in the titanic.
